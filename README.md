# Covid-19_Detection
AI-powered project that detects COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using CNNs and transfer learning (ResNet50). Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it enhances screening efficiency by classifying images as COVID-positive or normal. Trained on public datasets with high accuracy. For research use only.

🦠 COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images
This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to provide a fast and accessible tool to assist in the early screening of COVID-19 cases, especially in resource-limited settings.

🔍 Key Features
Built using TensorFlow and Keras

Utilizes CNN architecture and transfer learning (e.g., ResNet50)

Implements data augmentation to improve model robustness

Trained and evaluated on publicly available chest radiography datasets

Achieves high accuracy, precision, and recall in binary classification (COVID vs. Normal)

🚀 Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Pre-trained CNN models (ResNet50, VGG16, etc.)

Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
